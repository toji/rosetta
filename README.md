# Rosetta

Rosetta is a library of graphics API shader snippets written in multiple
different shading languages with the intent of providing an easy cross-reference
resource for developers. If, for example, you are familiar with WebGL, which
uses GLSL shaders, but new to WebGPU, which uses WGSL shaders, this page will
provide examples of how various tasks are accomplished in both languages so that
you can see how the GLSL concepts you are already familiar with map to WGSL.

## Contributing

Either new shader snippets or translations of existing snippets to new shading
languages are very welcome! See the guide to contributing on Github at
