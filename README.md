# Rosetta

Rosetta is a library of graphics API shader snippets written in multiple different shading languages
with the intent of providing an easy cross-reference resource for developers. If, for example, you
are familiar with WebGL, which uses GLSL shaders, but new to WebGPU, which uses WGSL shaders, this
page will provide examples of how various tasks are accomplished in both languages so that you can
see how the GLSL concepts you are already familiar with map to WGSL.
